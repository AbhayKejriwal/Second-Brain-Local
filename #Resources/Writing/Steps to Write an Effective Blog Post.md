Title: Steps to Write an Effective Blog Post

• Start with a compelling title  
  \- 8 out of 10 people read headlines, but only 2 out of 10 read the full article  
  \- Use magazine headlines for inspiration  
  \- Create multiple variations and choose the best one

• Write a strong introduction  
  \- Hook readers with a bold statement  
  \- Provide an overview of what the post will cover

• Structure the body of the post  
  \- Use subheadings for easy skimming  
  \- Keep paragraphs to 5-6 lines max  
  \- Link to other reputable sites for credibility

• End with a conclusion  
  \- Summarize the main points  
  \- Label it clearly as "Conclusion"  
  \- End with a question to encourage engagement

  \- Email people you've linked to in your post  
  \- Politely inform them and request a share
