Bullet points summary:

• Promote videos outside of YouTube:  
  \- Reach out to bloggers with similar content  
  \- Ask them to embed your video in their blog posts  
  \- This increases views and sends positive signals to YouTube

• Translate and transcribe videos into other languages:  
  \- YouTube is less competitive in non-English markets  
  \- Add subtitles in various languages (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish, German)  
  \- This expands your audience and increases views in different regions

• Leverage existing audience:  
  \- Use your website or email list to promote videos  
  \- Send email blasts about new YouTube content  
  \- Utilize push notifications to alert subscribers about new videos

• Embed videos in popular website content:  
  \- Identify your most popular blog posts using Google Analytics or Search Console  
  \- Embed relevant YouTube videos in these posts  
  \- This generates consistent views and improves user engagement metrics  
  \- Longer time on site can also improve overall Google rankings

• These strategies can help increase traffic to YouTube videos even without subscribers
