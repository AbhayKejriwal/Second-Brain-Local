Title: The One Habit That is Changing My Life: Set Systems Rather Than Goals

\- Shift focus from setting goals to creating systems and daily/weekly actions to achieve those goals  
\- Set a clear goal that provides direction  
\- Form a strategy by examining what has worked for you and others in the past  
\- Take one-time actions that can help solve the problem or move you towards the goal (e.g., hiring a coach, joining a group, spending money to eliminate obstacles)  
\- Create a system of daily or weekly actions that move you towards the goal  
\- **Commit to action using the 10-30-100 rule:**  
**\- 10 days of 100% compliance to test if the daily actions are sustainable**  
**\- 30 days of 90% compliance to see progress**  
**\- 100 days of 80% compliance to achieve major progress towards the goal**  
**\- If you fall off, start over with a new set of actions or adjust the current ones, and follow the 10-30-100 rule again**
