Title: How to Get Motivated Even When You Don't Feel Like It

\- Motivation is defined as the desire or impetus to initiate and maintain a particular behavior.  
\- There are two broad categories of motivation: intrinsic (doing an activity for its own sake) and extrinsic (pursuing a task as a means to an end).  
\- Intrinsic motivation, such as enjoying a hobby, is more likely to lead to long-term persistence compared to extrinsic rewards like money or praise.  
\- Having multiple motivators (both intrinsic and extrinsic) can sometimes lead to reduced overall motivation (the overjustification effect).  
\- For uninteresting or tedious tasks, adding extrinsic rewards can provide justification and motivation.  
\- To increase motivation, even when feeling unmotivated, focus on building intrinsic motivation by making the task more enjoyable in the moment (e.g., involving a friend, playing music).
