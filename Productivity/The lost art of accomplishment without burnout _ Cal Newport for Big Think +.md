• Main speaker: Cal Newport, computer scientist and author of "Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout"

Key points:  
• Burnout is increasing due to constant connectivity and visibility of work activities  
• Current productivity measures in knowledge work are flawed, based on manufacturing metrics  
• "Pseudo-productivity" uses visible activity as a proxy for useful effort  
• "Slow productivity" focuses on quality outcomes over time rather than constant activity

Three principles of slow productivity:  
1\. Do fewer things at once  
   • Reduces cognitive load and attention residue  
   • Improves work quality and completion speed

2\. Work at a natural pace  
   • Embrace seasonal variations in work intensity  
   • Allow for busy and less busy periods

3\. Obsess over quality  
   • Identify high-value activities in your work  
   • Invest in better tools and focus on improvement

Benefits of slow productivity:  
• Increased pace of completing important tasks  
• Higher quality of work produced  
• Improved happiness and sustainability in work environment
