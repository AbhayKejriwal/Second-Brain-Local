• Aim for a calorie surplus  
• Focus on calorie-dense meals (e.g., pesto pasta, burgers, pizza)

• Consume 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight

Increasing Appetite:  
• Drink lots of water to expand stomach capacity  
• Use a 5-minute timer during meals to eat faster and avoid distractions

Training:  
• Avoid "bro splits" (training one muscle group per session)  
• Use full-body workout splits (3 days a week)  
• Focus on heavy compound lifts (squats, bench press, deadlifts)  
• Include lighter hypertrophy exercises (bicep curls, tricep extensions)  
• Prioritize progressive overload  
• Allow 3-5 minutes rest between compound lifts, 1 minute for isolation exercises
