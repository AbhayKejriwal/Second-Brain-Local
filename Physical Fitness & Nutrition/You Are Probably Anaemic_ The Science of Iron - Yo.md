Title: "You Are Probably Anaemic: The Science of Iron"

Bullet Points:

\- Iron is formed in the cores of stars through nuclear fusion and released during supernova explosions.  
\- Iron plays a crucial role in the transport and storage of oxygen in living organisms through hemoglobin.  
\- Iron exists in two forms: heme (from animal sources) and non-heme (from plant sources).  
\- Heme iron is more readily absorbed by the body compared to non-heme iron.  
\- Indian diets, being predominantly plant-based, are high in compounds that inhibit non-heme iron absorption.  
\- Vegetarians in India are at a higher risk of developing iron deficiency anemia.  
\- Strategies to prevent iron deficiency include:  
\- Consuming meat, organ meats, or iron-rich plant foods paired with vitamin C.  
\- Avoiding tea, coffee, and calcium supplements with iron-rich meals.  
\- Considering iron supplements, preferably heme-based supplements.  
\- Monitoring iron levels through blood tests and supplementing only if needed.  
\- Avoiding excessive iron supplementation, which can lead to iron overload.
