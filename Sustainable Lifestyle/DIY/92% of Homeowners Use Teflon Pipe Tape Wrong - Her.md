Title: "92% of Homeowners Use Teflon Pipe Tape Wrong - Here's Why it Leaks"

Key points:  
\- Most DIYers use Teflon pipe tape incorrectly, leading to leaks  
\- Common mistakes:  
1\. Covering the first two tapered threads, which can interfere with fitting assembly  
2\. Not cleaning fittings properly before applying tape  
3\. Using metal brushes on plastic fittings, causing micro-scratches  
4\. Putting tape on backwards (counterclockwise)

\- Proper technique:  
1\. Clean fittings with a rag or toothbrush  
2\. Start taping from the back of the fitting, moving forward  
3\. Apply tape clockwise, keeping tension  
4\. Wrap 2-3 times, leaving the first two threads untaped

\- Types of tape:  
1\. Blue/white: standard, for metal or plastic pipes  
2\. Pink: thicker, for older or damaged threads  
3\. Yellow: exclusively for gas lines (not recommended for DIY)  
4\. Special tape for stainless steel fittings to prevent galling

\- Common mistake: Using tape when not needed (e.g., on fittings with rubber washers)
