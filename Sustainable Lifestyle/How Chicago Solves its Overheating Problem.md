Title: How Chicago Solves its Overheating Problem

Key points:  
\- Chicago experiences intense summer heat that can be deadly  
\- Cities are prone to the "heat island effect," raising temperatures by almost 10°F  
\- Air conditioning contributes to global warming by pushing heat outside

Solutions:  
1\. Green Roofs  
\- World's largest in Millennium Park  
\- 30-40°F lower indoor temperatures  
\- Reduce city-wide temperatures by up to 5°F  
\- 509 green roofs in Chicago

2\. Trees and Vegetation  
\- Provide shade and lower temperatures  
\- Shaded surfaces are 20-45°F cooler  
\- Remove air pollutants and sequester CO₂

3\. High-Albedo Surfaces  
\- Bright colors reflect more sunlight  
\- Raise reflectivity ratio, lowering temperatures

4\. Water Features  
\- Crown Fountain creates a unique microclimate  
\- Evaporative and convective cooling effects

5\. District Cooling  
\- Largest system in the U.S.  
\- 115 buildings serviced by 5 central plants  
\- Saves 20% in cooling costs  
\- Uses ice as a "temperature battery"

6\. Passive Design Strategies  
\- Pre-1920 buildings use less energy per square foot  
\- Monadnock Building (1893) vs. Federal Plaza (1960s)  
\- Thick walls, open windows, narrow design vs. thin glass facade

7\. Modern Adaptations  
\- Schreiber Center incorporates old techniques  
\- Atrium for natural ventilation  
\- Automated venetian blinds for sun control  
\- High-tech windows reduce energy by 30%

Conclusion:  
\- Urban cooling strategies make cities more livable and sustainable  
\- Old practices from 100+ years ago are still effective today
