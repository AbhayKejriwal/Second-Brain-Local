## About
Ancient Haudenosaunee wisdom of the Three Sisters farming method is more sustainable than modern industrial farming.
This method benefits soil health, water usage, and reduces reliance on harmful fertilizers.
## Summary
## Seneca Chief Handsome Lake's Vision

* **Initial Vision:**  Handsome Lake, a Seneca chief, has a vision while near death, encountering the spirits of corn, beans, and squash (the Three Sisters).
* **Context:**  The vision occurs following a brutal military campaign against the Haudenosaunee.  The chief felt despair.

## The Three Sisters

* **Interconnectedness:** The spirits explain how the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash) support each other in growth and resilience.
* **Corn (Elder Sister):** Provides a sturdy stalk for the beans to climb, offering structural support.
* **Beans (Middle Sister):** Climb the corn stalk, capturing more sunlight and increasing nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.
* **Squash (Youngest Sister):** Provides shade and protection from animals, keeping the soil moist.
* **Symbiotic Relationships:** The Three Sisters rely on each other for growth and survival, emphasizing the interconnectedness of nature.

## Modern vs Ancient Farming

* **Modern Industrial Farming Issues:**
    * **Monocropping:** Depletes soil nutrients.
    * **Soil Degradation:** One-third of the world's soil is moderately to highly degraded.    ![[Pasted image 20241224192015.png]]
    * **Overuse of Fertilizers:**  Release greenhouse gases and pollute water sources due to inefficiency.
    * **Water-Intensive Practices:**  70% of the world's water is used in farming.
* **Advantages of the Three Sisters:**
    * **Nutrient Efficiency:**  The Three Sisters use nutrients more efficiently when planted together.
    * **Reduced Fertilizer Needs:**  Beans decrease the need for nitrogen-based fertilizers.
    * **Improved Soil Health:**  Squash improves soil moisture retention.
* **Regenerative Agriculture:** The Three Sisters example highlights regenerative agriculture practices that recognize nature's interconnectedness and promote sustainable food systems.
