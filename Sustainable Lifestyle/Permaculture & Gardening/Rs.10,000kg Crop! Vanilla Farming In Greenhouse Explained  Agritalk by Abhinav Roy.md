## About
Vanilla farming in greenhouses is explained, highlighting its high potential profitability (Rs.10,000/kg).  The video details temperature, humidity, and soil requirements, along with pollination and harvesting techniques.
## Summary
- **Introduction:**
    * Video introduction in Hyderabad, focusing on a new crop (vanilla).
    * High economic value of vanilla is highlighted.
    * Vanilla cultivation in India is primarily in polyhouses, especially in Kerala.
    * Video will be in a mix of Hindi and English, with Telugu also present.
    * Channel subscription and watching the whole video are encouraged.

- **Temperature Requirements for Vanilla Cultivation:**
    * Vanilla tolerates up to 40°C but thrives best between 24-31°C.
    * Higher temperatures (above 36°C) can be detrimental.
    * Comfortable temperature range for optimal flower and fruit production.

- **Humidity Requirements:**
    * Humidity should be maintained between 70-80%.

- **Steps in Vanilla Farming in Polyhouses (Outside Kerala):**
    * Polyhouses are crucial to control temperature, especially in regions with high summer temperatures.
    * Cooling systems (fan pad systems) are recommended.
    * Soilless cultivation is preferred using a mixture of coco peat and vermi-compost (40-60% ratio).
    * Other organic additives (neem powder, charcoal) are added.
    * Bed dimensions: 5-6 inches deep, 3 feet wide, and 1.5 feet distance between beds.
    * Planting distance: 1 foot between plants.
    * Side plates are used to contain the growing medium.

- **Irrigation:**
    * Drip irrigation or regular watering is recommended, depending on the setup.
    * Avoiding soil-borne diseases is important.

- **Pollination:**
    * Vanilla is a self-pollinating crop.
    * Manual pollination is necessary by opening and closing flower petals.

- **Vanilla Varieties:**
    * Indian/Asian and African varieties are discussed.
    * Variety testing is important.

- **Harvesting and Post-Harvesting:**
    * Harvesting time: 1.5-4 months after flowering.
    * Beans are dried after harvesting.
    * Dried beans can be stored for two years without damage.

- **Production Cycle:**
    * Vanilla plants take 1-1.5 years to start yielding.
    * Subsequent years (2nd to 6th): Yields increase, reaching up to 6kg per plant.
    * Yield per plant varies based on plant health and care.

- **Production per Acre:**
    * Planting density: ~3500 plants per quarter-acre.
    * Yield per plant: ~800 grams.

- **Seed Categories:**
    * Beans are categorized by size (grade A, B, C) and quality.
    * Quality depends on proper fertilization.
    * Grade A beans usually command a higher price.

- **Nutrient Requirements:**
    * Organic fertilizers are preferred for optimal growth and yield.
    * Correct EC (electrical conductivity) and pH (6.5-7) values are important for soil.
    * Water quality with TDS (total dissolved solids) below 250 is recommended.

- **Propagation:**
    * Cuttings are used for propagation.
    * Propagation is best done after flowering.
    * Source and cost of plants vary.

- **Economics:**
    * Investment per quarter-acre: ~50-60 lakh rupees.
    * Expected yield: ~50-60 lakh rupees per quarter-acre.
    * Break-even period: 1.5-2 years.
    * Market and demand for vanilla are discussed.
    * Challenges and reasons for fewer vanilla farmers are briefly touched upon.

- **Conclusion:**
    * Video concludes with a summary and encourages further questions and topics for future videos.
