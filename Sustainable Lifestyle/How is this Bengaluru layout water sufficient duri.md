Title: How This Bengaluru Layout Remains Water Sufficient During a Water Crisis

Key Points:  
\- Classic Jud layout in South Bangalore has saved water for over a decade  
\- 400+ houses built across 71 acres  
\- Sells water to BWSSB (Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board)

Community Water Harvesting Techniques:  
\- Maximizing rainwater collection  
\- Reducing runoff  
\- Providing large storage spaces  
\- Groundwater recharge

Three Fundamentals:  
1\. No borewells in individual sites  
2\. Three large wells  
3\. Community borewells for use during BWSSB supply shortages

Five R's to Save Water (10+ years):  
1\. Recharge  
2\. Reuse  
3\. Reduce  
4\. Recycle  
5\. Restore

Water Conservation Methods:  
\- 70+ community recharge pits  
\- Restored old wells for portable water  
\- Water used for parks and common areas  
\- Periodic campaigns to educate on water conservation

Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) Process:  
1\. Raw water from all houses collected (350 KLD/day)  
2\. Pumped into aeration station  
3\. Larger aeration tank for sedimentation and processing  
4\. External tank for sand and carbon filtration  
5\. Carbon filter removes foul smell  
6\. Recycled water stored in sumps and underground tanks  
7\. Pumped to multiple storage units across the layout

Additional Points:  
\- STP runs on solar power  
\- Community made sustainable water management decisions  
\- Preparing for climate change
