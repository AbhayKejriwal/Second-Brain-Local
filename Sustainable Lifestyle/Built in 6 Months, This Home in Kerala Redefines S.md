\- The house, named "allerin" (Alan + Zarin), was designed and built by an architect-contractor couple, Zarin and Alan.  
\- Located 2 km from Kochi's Infopark, facing an expansive paddy field, the design aimed to coexist with nature and surroundings.  
\- Built using insulated steel panel technology, allowing construction in just 6 months.  
\- The panels provide insulation, reducing AC requirements by 45%, and are strong for earthquake resistance.  
\- Features include a communal living space, sliding glass panels opening to a veranda with a plunge pool, bedrooms overlooking the veranda.  
\- Sustainability features: solar panels for power, rainwater harvesting into a pond, laterite plaster (earthy material palette).  
\- The roof is planted with viver (a plant traditionally used to cool water) to help cool the space below.  
\- Leftover panels were repurposed into furniture like dining tables and center tables.  
\- The design aimed for transparency, blending with the neighborhood, allowing neighbors to enjoy the view and space.  
\- The focus was on creating an experience of coexisting with nature rather than a unique architectural concept.
