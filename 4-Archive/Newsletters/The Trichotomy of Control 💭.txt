## Summary:

This email newsletter from Ali Abdaal focuses on the concept of "The Trichotomy of Control" as a way to manage expectations and reduce emotional stress.  He introduces the concept and explains how it relates to the Stoic philosophy, using personal anecdotes and examples to illustrate the idea. He also mentions his new YouTube videos on slowing down time and designing your dream life, as well as his book Feel-Good Productivity. The newsletter ends with a sponsorship message for YNAB, a spending app that helps manage money mindset.

## The Trichotomy of Control ðŸ’­

Hey friends,

One of the things I enjoy most about having a newsletter is being able to look back on what past-Ali was thinking about. It's funny to think I used to write these issues last thing at night before an early hospital shift. 

This week, I'd like to share some important Stoic insights that I'd forgotten about:

Let's talk about control.  In a recent video, I alluded to the Stoic idea of how there are only two things we can control - namely our own thoughts and our own actions.  I said that everything else falls in the realm of "things we can't control." Therefore, we should not concern ourselves with those things. 

But today, a friend came over for dinner. He's a teacher in a secondary school in South London and shared an idea he uses with his students: **the Trichotomy of Control**.

The **Trichotomy of Control** adds important nuance to the idea that we should only concern ourselves with things within our control.  It tells us that many things in our daily lives lie in the realm of "things over which we have some but not complete control."  Examples include getting an A* in Maths or getting a first class degree. You can probably think of many other examples. 

We have *some* control over these outcomes, but they are not *entirely* within our control because external factors can influence them - like the performance of our peers, the difficulty of the exam paper, or the examiner's feelings on a given day. 

William Irvine, in his book "A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy," explains this further:

> I think that when a Stoic concerns himself with things over which he has some but not complete control, such as winning a tennis match, he will be very careful about the goals he sets for himself. In particular, he will be careful to set internal rather than external goals. Thus, his goal in playing tennis will not be to win a match (something external, over which he has only partial control) but to play to the best of his ability in the match (something internal, over which he has complete control). 

> The Stoics realized that our internal goals will affect our external performance, but they also realized that the goals we consciously set for ourselves can have a dramatic impact on our subsequent emotional state. In particular, if we consciously set winning a tennis match as our goal, we arguably donâ€™t increase our chances of winning that match. In fact, we might even hurt our chances: If it starts looking, early on, as though we are going to lose the match, we might become flustered, and this might negatively affect our playing in the remainder of the game, thereby hurting our chances of winning.

> Furthermore, by having winning the match as our goal, we dramatically increase our chances of being upset by the outcome of the match. If, on the other hand, we set playing our best in a match as our goal, we arguably donâ€™t lessen our chances of winning the match, but we do lessen our chances of being upset by the outcome of the match. Thus, internalizing our goals with respect to tennis would appear to be a no-brainer: To set as our goal playing to the best of our ability has an upsideâ€” reduced emotional anguish in the futureâ€” with little or no downside.

This sort of thinking applies to almost everything in our lives. 

I'd completely forgotten about the Trichotomy of Control despite reading it in Irvine's book years ago. This reminds me that I should spend more time reviewing my Kindle highlights. 

I'll make more of an effort to actively review the stuff I've highlighted in these books, and will try to share the wisdom I come across in this weekly email and maybe a new YouTube series. 

Have a great week!

Ali xx
