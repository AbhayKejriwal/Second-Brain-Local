## The Strategic 'Yes': How to Open Doors to Unseen Possibilities 👀

This newsletter discusses the importance of saying "yes" to opportunities that may not seem like obvious wins. Ali Abdaal argues that these "wooden door" opportunities can lead to unexpected connections, perspectives, and realisations that can have a significant impact on your business and life. 

He shares his experience of saying yes to speak at the ConvertKit Craft & Commerce conference, despite the initial drawbacks, and highlights the substantial benefits he gained from attending. These include meeting valuable mentors, receiving valuable marketing advice, connecting with other creators, and gaining new perspectives on his business.

Ali proposes a framework for deciding which opportunities are worth pursuing, based on whether they energise you, could lead to new insights, and if you want to build a relationship with the asker. He emphasizes that saying "yes" to wooden door opportunities requires commitment, including building relationships, asking for advice, and gaining new perspectives. 

The newsletter also includes Ali's personal recommendations for a book, podcast, and TV show, along with his new YouTube video.
