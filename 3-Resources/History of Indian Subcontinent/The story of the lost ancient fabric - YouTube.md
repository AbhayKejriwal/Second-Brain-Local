Title: The Story of the Lost Ancient Fabric - DACA Muslin

\- Over 2 centuries ago, DACA muslin was the most expensive fabric in the world, 26 times more expensive than silk.  
\- It was worn by royalty and the elite, including Marie Antoinette, Romans, Mughal Emperors, ancient Greeks, and even mentioned by Jane Austen.  
\- For the last 200 years, no one has been able to make this fabric, until recently.  
\- The fabric was produced in Mughal India during the time of the British East India Company.  
\- Robert Clive, also known as "Clive of India," seized control of the state of Bengal in 1757.  
\- The East India Company exploited local artisans, forcing them to make more fabric for less pay.  
\- DACA muslin had an extraordinary 1,200 thread count, making it very fine and translucent.  
\- It was made from a specific cotton plant (futi carpas) that grew only on the riverbanks of the Magna.  
\- The British cotton industry felt threatened and implemented bans (Calico Acts) on cotton fabric imports.  
\- Eventually, British mills started producing lower-quality knockoffs of DACA muslin.  
\- The exploitation and competition led to the disappearance of the artisans and the futi carpas plant.  
\- In 2013, Saol Islam started a journey to rediscover DACA muslin.  
\- He found a genetic match for the futi carpas plant and recreated the fabric, but not yet at the original 1,200 thread count.  
\- The story highlights the consequences of greed, short-termism, and the relentless pursuit of profit in the fashion industry.

I'm from Dhaka and have been fascinated with Muslin all my life. The sad thing is there are ancient fabrics disappearing every day. Rajshahi silk is gone, as is real Tussore and even proper khadi. One thing you perhaps skipped either for the sake of time or to avoid sensation is that in line with the Calico Acts the production of fabric was outlawed in India. Raw cotton was grown, harvested and shipped to Manchester where it was spun into very crude industrial cloth and shipped back to be sold to natives who initially had no interest in buying it. The solution was to ban spinning and weaving, a ban enforced by removing the thumbs of anyone caught with a wheel or a loom in their posession. You may recall that one of Mahatma Gandhi's first acts of rebellion was to spin cloth at a wheel. This was an urbane chap, a trained lawyer who wore suits but when he became a freedom activist he learned first to spin and weave his own cloth and for the rest of his life that was all he would ever wear. Today the spinning wheel is at the centre of India's flag. All because the Calico Acts were so emblematic of (greater) India's subjugation. Secondly cultivation of carpas was replaced by the British with jute and in some places indigo. They had no use for carpas cotton because their mills couldn't use it and its continued cultivation posed a threat to their monopoly. These two reasons, banning the local manufacture of cloth and destroying the plant are the main reasons why Muslin disappeared and as for the 16 steps, Saiful Islam's team eventually concluded that there was something missing. Perhaps as some small act of resistance, the workers had not revealed all of their secrets to their overlords. Want to know what I consider poetic justice? Bangladesh has come back today as the world's largest manufacturer of clothing (bar China of course, the anomalous outlier in every industry).
