## 30 Lessons for my 30s

This newsletter is Ali Abdaal's reflection on turning 30 and the lessons he learned in the past decade. He shares his personal advice on life, work, and relationships, including the importance of living in the present moment, cultivating deep relationships, and prioritizing joy. He also discusses the benefits of delegation and introduces Athena, a service that helps with personal and business productivity through delegation. 

**Some Advice to Myself I’m hoping to take into my 30s:**

* Life is lived in the present moment. Don’t let the pursuit of more stop you from enjoying what you already have - enough.
* If you’re going to pursue “more”, remember to keep your life balanced, especially in terms of your health and relationships.
* Build systems into your life to help you focus on life rather than just work.
* There’s no “achievement” you could possibly achieve that’ll make you any happier than you are right now.
* If you find yourself saying: “But the money’s just too good”, think twice. Then think a third time. Do you really want to do that thing just for the money?
* A stress-filled life is bad for your health, your relationships and your lifespan. Chill out, and don’t take things so seriously.
* Everything you’re doing is meaningless - a few years after you’re dead, no one’s going to remember you or anything you’ve done.
* Everything you’re doing is profoundly meaningful - even the smallest action is drenched with meaning. Remember to get out of your own head and appreciate that.
* It’s okay to trade consistency for joy… just don’t do it too often, lest the “costs” of bad habits build to the point that it reduces joy over the long-term.
* With a little creativity, you can make absolutely everything 10-40% more enjoyable.
* Your work would probably be better if you focused on enjoying it, rather than on trying to make it better.
* Regularly ask yourself: “10 years from now, what will I be really glad I did consistently for 10 years?”. Do those things consistently for 10 years.
* Train weights 3-4 times a week with a personal trainer, forever. You’ve got the money. You’ve got the time. There’s no reason not to.
* Any money, time or effort you spend on your health will pay major dividends as you age.
* Any money, time or effort you spend on cultivating deep relationships will pay major dividends right now, and also as you age.
* Invite friends over for coworking and/or food more often.
* You don’t have to sit in a restaurant when meeting up with someone. You can grab some food or coffee, and go for a walk instead. It’s healthier and more fun.
* If it’s not a “hell yeah”, it should probably be a “no thank you” (ht Derek Sivers).
* Be the lead organiser of social events for your friends. They all want to hang out, they just suck at organising things.
* Read fiction before bed.
* If you want to get better at something, hire a teacher or coach in person. It’s more fun, and more effective, than trying to teach yourself.
* Do whatever you can to work with people in-person. It’s way more fun than remote. And what’s the point of working if it’s not fun?
* Go to the cinema and/or to dinner, by yourself, once in a while.
* Send more thank you notes to people.
* Carve out some time for life admin and for replying to messages each day. It doesn’t have to be Deep Work for it to be valuable.
* Keep your personal CRM maintained with birthdays, addresses and notes about each person you want to stay in touch with. It doesn’t take much time to send a birthday card or gift, and those things can maintain relationships for literally decades.
* Use a treadmill desk whenever you can - it’s a cheat code for getting more steps in while working.
* Take more photos, preferably with a proper camera, but your phone is totally fine if you don’t have your proper camera with you.
* Carve out dedicated time each week for learning and exploring your curiosity. Life’s only going to get busier, and you don’t want to stagnate because you haven’t made time for continuous learning.
* When you’re faced with a choice to prioritise work or to prioritise your life, choose your life.

**👨‍💻 If you don’t have an assistant, you are the assistant.**

If you’ve ever looked at someone and thought: “How do they manage to do it all? They seem to have effortlessly optimised their entire life”. Well, the secret is they don’t do it all - they delegate. 

I’ve read hundreds of books about how to level up my business and personal life. But it wasn’t until I discovered the skill of delegation, with a little help from Athena elite executive assistants, that everything became exponentially better.

**Athena** spends hours understanding your business and life, training the top 1% of assistants, researching the latest AI tools, and pulling from 100s of member-only playbooks to amplify your entire productivity system.

This lets you win your time back and shift your energy from being perpetually caught up in ‘busy work’, to focusing on what truly moves the needle. And because Athena is tailored to your lifestyle, whether you’re a beginner or a pro delegator, together you can create a personal system that takes specific projects off of your plate - from juggling emails to handling mundane bookings or crafting the next big piece of content.

Have a great week!
