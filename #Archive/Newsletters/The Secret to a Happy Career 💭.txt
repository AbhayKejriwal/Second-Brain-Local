## The Secret to a Happy Career ðŸ’­

This email from Ali Abdaal reflects on the similarities between the creator economy and a tenured university professor's role. He argues that creators, while often feeling pressure to earn large sums of money, should focus on the freedom and opportunity they have, just like a professor. 

**Here's the gist:**

-  A tenured professor has job security, freedom to pursue interests, and gets paid to explore them. 
-  Creators are similarly funded by their audience to explore their passions and share their journeys.
-  The pressure to earn six or seven figures as a creator can be unrealistic, and comparing yourself to others can be detrimental to your happiness.
-  Instead, focus on the freedom and flexibility your career allows you. 

**Here's the main content of the email:**

Hey friends,

This week, at a friendâ€™s wedding, I ended up chatting to someone who turned out to be a university professor. She teaches artificial intelligence, and we got to talking about her job. It was interesting because, while she mentioned the job doesnâ€™t pay muchâ€”university jobs often donâ€™tâ€”itâ€™s a job for life. She has tenure, which means sheâ€™s got job security and a lot of freedom.

She gets paid to explore whatever interests her, with a few teaching and admin duties thrown in. It struck me as an absolute dream job: getting funded to pursue your passions and occasionally share your knowledge.

As we were talking, it realised how similar this is to what we do in the creator economy. As creators, our audience funds us to cover our expenses (and then some), letting us to dive into whatever interests us and share that journey with them. Yet, thereâ€™s this pervasive idea that to be successful as a creator, you need to be pulling in six or seven figures.

We hear so many stories about creators making millions, and it sets this unrealistic benchmark that can make us feel inadequate.

But what if we were to reframe our roles? Imagine seeing yourself as a tenured professor in the modern world. Instead of a university paying your bills, itâ€™s your audience. You get to explore whatever interests you, make content about it whenever you feel like it, and your audience supports you.

Sounds pretty cool to me.

For example - If a university offered me tenure with a salary of Â£30k-Â£50k a year to explore my interests and occasionally publish my findings, Iâ€™d think that was an incredible deal. Many creators I know earn at least that much, sometimes even Â£100k+ a year, and yet they still feel like itâ€™s not enough. Tenured professors (at least the few I know), seem to be generally content with their setup. Sure, they might do some consulting or extra work on the side to bring in extra cash, but the core of their happiness lies in the freedom to explore their curiosity, and learn and teach stuff.

If youâ€™re constantly surrounded by multi-millionaire entrepreneurs, itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of feeling like youâ€™re not measuring up. You start comparing yourself to these high achievers and think your life isnâ€™t as good because youâ€™re not taking as many holidays or buying as many fancy things. But when you step back and compare your situation to someone making less and working a traditional 40-hour week, suddenly your life looks pretty fantastic.

I guess itâ€™s all about perspective. Imagine being a creator who earns enough to cover your expensesâ€”letâ€™s say around Â£30k-Â£50k a year. That might not sound like a lot when youâ€™re comparing yourself to the mega-influencers, but think about what that really means. It means you have the freedom to wake up each day and decide what you want to work on. You can dive into your passions, create content about whatever excites you, and engage with a community that appreciates your work. Youâ€™re essentially your own boss, and you get to share your journey with others.

This is where I found myself enjoying the parallel to being a tenured professor. Tenured professors have a structured environmentâ€”they know they have to teach certain classes and do some admin dutiesâ€”but beyond that, they have the freedom to explore their academic interests. Creators, in a similar vein, might have some obligations like posting regularly or engaging with their audience, but they also have an incredible amount of freedom to pursue whatever interests them.

The beauty of being a creator is that your "tenure" isnâ€™t tied to a single institution. Instead, itâ€™s supported by a diverse audience that values what you do. Youâ€™re not beholden to one entity. Instead, youâ€™re supported by people who appreciate your unique perspective and content. This decentralisation of support can actually be more stable and fulfilling, as it allows for a broader range of interests and the ability to pivot as your passions evolve.

Try this mental shift...

So, if youâ€™re a creator feeling the pressure to earn more or constantly comparing yourself to the top-tier influencers, try this mental shift. Try seeing yourself as a modern-day tenured professor, funded by an audience that values your work. This perspective can help you appreciate the incredible freedom and opportunity you have, which is something many people dream of but very few actually get.

Iâ€™ll end with this note to self: in the end, work is all about finding joy in what you do and appreciating the support that lets you do it. Comparing yourself to others can be a slippery slope, but if you take a step back and look at your career through other lenses, you might just find a renewed sense of gratitude and excitement for your work.

Have a great week!
