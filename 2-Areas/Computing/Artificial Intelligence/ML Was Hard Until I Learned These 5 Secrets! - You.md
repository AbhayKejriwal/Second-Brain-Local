Title: ML Was Hard Until I Learned These 5 Secrets!

\- Secret 1: Think of math as translating human ideas into formal language, not as abstract formulas  
\- Scientists think in natural language first, then translate to math  
\- Focus on the underlying concept, not just the formulas

\- Secret 2: Mathematical derivations apply a set of rules/tricks  
\- Each step follows a rule or definition  
\- Build a "toolkit" of common rules/patterns to recognize

\- Secret 3: Debugging is coding  
\- Writing a few lines can take hours of debugging - this is normal  
\- Don't get discouraged, debugging is part of the coding process

\- Secret 4: To understand large codebases  
\- Start with the train.py and eval.py files  
\- Step through with a debugger to get an overview

\- Secret 5: Mastering ML takes tremendous time and effort  
\- Don't expect to master it quickly - the 10,000 hour rule applies  
\- Have realistic expectations and enjoy the learning process
