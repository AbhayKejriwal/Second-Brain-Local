# Water from Air? How a Bengaluru Startup is Trying to Solve the Drinking Water Crisis

- India recorded its highest-ever temperatures in 2024, with Delhi hitting 52.3°C, causing severe water shortages
- Water tankers became the only source of water for thousands in Bengaluru as Indian cities went dry
- A facility in Bengaluru produces nearly 4,000 liters of water daily without using groundwater, lakes, or rivers - extracting it from air instead

## The Origin Story

- Founders were studying at National Institute of Technology Calicut when a heatwave dried up their water supply
- They lived on 2-3 buckets of rationed water per day for 3-4 weeks
- This experience raised the question: "If Kerala can face such drought, what would happen to the rest of the world?"
- The atmosphere holds the largest amount of invisible water, inspiring them to find ways to capture it

## Uru Labs and Its Technology

- Founded in 2019 to develop air-to-water technology
- Existing solutions functioned like air conditioners but had limitations:
    - High power consumption
    - Dependence on high relative humidity
    - Poor performance in interior and dry areas
- After two years, Uru Labs developed desiccant-based technology:
    - Uses calcium chloride solution to absorb moisture from air
    - The solution is passed through "Paul Rings" (cylindrical structures) to increase surface area
    - The moisture-rich solution is heated to 60-65°C using renewable energy sources
    - The resulting steam is condensed into pure water
    - Essential minerals (magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, zinc) are added for drinking purposes

## Production and Packaging

- The facility produces water at 3-4 rupees per liter (compared to 0.20-0.60 rupees for traditional mineral water)
- Uses eco-friendly, reusable glass bottles
- Automated cleaning, filling, sealing, and quality checking process
- Currently targeting premium restaurants and hotels emphasizing sustainability

## Importance and Future Impact

- More than 16.3 crore (163 million) Indians lack access to clean drinking water
- Climate change and erratic rainfall are depleting groundwater sources
- Air moisture replenishes naturally in 8-10 days, unlike groundwater which takes much longer
- Solutions like water from air could make a significant difference when implemented at scale
