Title: The Future of Humanity's Energy No One Knows About | Terraform

\- Terraform is working on creating a synthetic hydrocarbon supply chain by combining carbon dioxide from the air with hydrogen from water electrolysis to produce methane (natural gas).  
\- This process can break the limitation of finite fossil fuel resources and provide an alternative source of hydrocarbons.  
\- Around 2/3 to 3/4 of humanity's energy consumption is in the form of hydrocarbons, making it a crucial energy source.  
\- The direct air capture of CO2 and the electrolysis of water using solar energy are key components of the process.  
\- The methane produced can substitute for fossil oil and gas, eliminating the need to extract carbon from the ground.  
\- Terraform is working on scaling up the technology and aims to deploy millions of units to service global hydrocarbon demand by 2040.  
\- The goal is to accelerate the transition to synthetic hydrocarbons, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change impacts.  
\- The process involves various stages, including a kiln for capturing CO2, electrolyzers for hydrogen production, and reactors for methane synthesis.  
\- Terraform emphasizes the importance of making the entire system extremely cost-effective and energy-efficient to make it economically viable.
