Key points:  
• Companion planting is an ancient agricultural technique  
• Examples include:  
- Three sisters method: beans, corn, and squash  
- Tomatoes with flowers for bee pollination  
• Plants actively protect themselves from predators  
- Physical defenses (e.g., rose thorns)  
- Chemical defenses (e.g., cucumbers producing allelopathic chemicals)  
• Weed control through companion planting:  
- Winter rye inhibits seed germination of common weeds  
- Cucumbers can inhibit weeds between tomato plants  
• Trap crops:  
- Nasturtium attracts pests away from brassicas  
- Radishes or bok choy can divert flea beetles from tomatoes  
- Cowpeas can attract stink bugs away from tomatoes  
• Beneficial insect attraction:  
- Sweet alyssum attracts braconid wasps, which prey on tomato hornworms and aphids  
• Biofumigant properties:  
- Brassicas, especially mustards, can help control soil-borne diseases  
• Soil improvement:  
- Legumes (peas, beans) fix nitrogen in the soil  
- Best to grow nitrogen-fixing plants before main crops  
• Pollination enhancement:  
- Planting diverse flowers improves pollination for vegetables  
- Flowers also beautify the garden  
• Simple combinations:  
- Tomatoes and basil as a companion planting example
