• Companion planting: Growing specific plants together for mutual benefits  
  
• Peppers:  
- Plant with eggplant for natural shade  
- Pair with basil for ground cover and culinary uses  
  
• Tomatoes:  
- Plant with basil for pest deterrence and flavor pairing  
- Use French marigolds to repel root-knot nematodes  
- Grow lettuce in tomato shade for summer harvests  
  
• Cucumbers:  
- Plant with corn as a natural trellis  
- Use buckwheat and radishes to deter cucumber beetles  
  
• Corn:  
- Traditional "Three Sisters" planting with beans and squash  
- Add amaranth for additional harvest  
  
• Bush Beans:

• Potatoes:  
- Plant with beans to deter potato beetles  
- Use horseradish, garlic, or marigolds for pest control  
- Employ "subterranean method" by planting quick-growing crops above buried potatoes  
  
The transcript emphasizes the importance of understanding plant relationships and ecosystem dynamics for successful companion planting.
