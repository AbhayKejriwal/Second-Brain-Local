# Summary
## Core Philosophy

- The builders view nature as humanity's intended habitat, emphasizing the importance of clean air and forest living
- Goal was to create a sustainable house appealing to urban sensibilities while using traditional techniques
- Project aimed to demonstrate that sustainable, mud-based construction can be beautiful and modern

## Construction Materials & Techniques

- Primary wall material is rammed earth (with lime and gravel), built in 9cm layers
- Local stone used for some walls, employing village craftsmen
- Lime plaster used instead of toxic paint for wall finishing
- Five different roofing systems implemented:
    - Catalan arch/flood dome (built without shuttering or steel)
    - Wooden roof with rafters (no steel required)
    - Filler slab with decorative elements
    - Metal pipes with sandstone
    - Madras roof (wood rafters with brick tiles)

## Sustainable Features

- Walls are 13.5 inches thick for thermal mass (keeps house cool in summer, warm in winter)
- Underground cellar maintains 25°C temperature even when outside reaches 46°C
- Rainwater harvesting system collects approximately 150,000 liters during rainy season
- Greywater recycling through mulched garden beds with lemongrass
- Human waste processed through biodigester, with liquid fertilizing gardens
- Natural, non-toxic bathroom products used throughout

## Design Philosophy

- House divided into public and private areas
- Placement considers natural water flow and vegetation patterns
- Western edge protected by existing plantings to block sun
- Large windows connect indoor spaces with surrounding gardens
- Designed to last 100-200 years, eliminating need for future rebuilding
- Construction prioritizes paying local labor rather than expensive materials
