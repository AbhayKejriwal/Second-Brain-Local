Here's a summary of the video transcript in bullet points:  
  
• Title: "How to keep your house cool in the summer without AC"  
  
• Night cooling strategy:  
- Open a window in the room you want to cool most  
- Open another window across the house  
- Place a fan pointing outward at the second window  
- This creates a low-pressure system, drawing cool air in through the first window  
  
• Basement cooling:  
- Use a fan in the basement pointing upstairs to spread cooler air  
  
• Daytime measures:  
- Close windows when outside temperature exceeds desired indoor temperature  
- Draw curtains and blinds to block direct sunlight  
- Minimize heat absorption by counters and floors  
  
• Let house insulation maintain cooler indoor temperatures
