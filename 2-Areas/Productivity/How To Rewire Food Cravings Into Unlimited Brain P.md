\- Elite performers use chrononutrition (nutrition timed with circadian rhythms) to access flow state and peak performance

1\. Differentiate between flow meals (for fueling focus) and ritual meals (for enjoyment)  
2\. Intermittent fasting  
3\. Food timing - eat flow meals aligned with your peak energy chronotype  
\- Tips for flow meals:  
\- Find your high flow foods through self-experimentation  
\- Eat the same simple, automated flow meals consistently  
\- Prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods  
\- Benefits of fasting:  
\- Promotes metabolic fitness and blood sugar control  
\- Gives mental clarity and flow state access  
\- For peak performance, balance is key:

\- Focus on whole food sources, macros, avoiding intolerances  
\- To get/stay lean for optimal flow:
