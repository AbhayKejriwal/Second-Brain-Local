Here's a bullet point summary of the key points from the transcript:

Title: "Harvard's stress expert on how to be more resilient | Dr. Aditi Nerurkar"

• Stress is an inescapable part of life, like gravity  
• Societal perceptions often prevent people from openly sharing their struggles  
• The goal is to manage stress, not eliminate it entirely  
• Dr. Aditi Nerurkar is a Harvard physician specializing in stress, burnout, and resilience  
• She became an expert after experiencing burnout during her medical residency  
• The "resilience myth" falsely suggests that resilient people don't experience stress or burnout  
• True resilience involves honoring boundaries and practicing self-compassion  
• Two types of stress: adaptive (healthy) and maladaptive (unhealthy)  
• Stress affects brain function, shifting control from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala  
• Chronic stress keeps the amygdala active, leading to a constant state of fight-or-flight  
• Stress amplifies the inner critic and makes negative experiences "sticky" in the brain  
• Early childhood experiences can influence stress responses throughout life  
• Neuroplasticity allows the brain to change and adapt, even after difficult experiences  
• Two simple stress reset techniques:  
  1\. "Stop, breathe, and be" exercise  
  2\. Gratitude practice  
• Managing stress is a learnable skill, not an innate ability  
• It's possible to rewire the brain for less stress and more resilience

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific points?
