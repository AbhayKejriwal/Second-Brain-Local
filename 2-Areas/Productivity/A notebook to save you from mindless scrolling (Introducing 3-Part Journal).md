Planning and reflecting

* The concept was born from observing mindless phone scrolling habits and was designed to help create more intentional use of time while keeping the journaling process simple and efficient

* The journal consists of three main sections:
  1. Goal Setting Section (First pages)
     - Space for up to 3 goals with a 3-month timeline
     - Includes habit/action trackers for daily progress
     - Goals remain visible as an extendable reminder page

  2. Planning Section (Left side)
     - Top third: Action tasks related to goals
     - Bottom two-thirds: Daily chores and responsibilities
     - Written the day before with tomorrow's date
     - Combines "leading life" (goal-directed) and "managing life" (daily tasks)    

  3. Reflection Section (Right side)
     - Space for daily reflections about progress
     - Includes prompts like "what threw a pebble into your pond of mind?" - what made you feel strongly today
     - Focuses on analyzing emotions, actions, and areas for improvement
     - Helps build self-awareness and refine approaches

* Key benefits of the system:
  - Takes as little as 3 minutes per day
  - Helps prevent directionless default behaviors
  - Creates tangible accountability through physical presence
  - Provides structure while maintaining simplicity
  - Can be implemented using any notebook with lined or dotted pages

* The system was originally designed for someone who prefers minimal time journaling but has proven effective enough that users often choose to spend more time with it than the minimal 3 minutes suggested
