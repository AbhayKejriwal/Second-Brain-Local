Title: 7 Simple Concepts That Make My Life Better

1\. Draw, Don't Just Journal  
\- Drawing taps into a deeper, less restricted part of yourself  
\- Allows for symbolism and interpretation  
\- Gives more room to explore ideas before perfecting them  
\- Helpful when feeling lost or confused

2\. Label Life Phases  
\- Not possible to go full blast in all domains of life  
\- Look at life in terms of seasons, each with a main focus  
\- Give yourself permission to focus on one area without guilt  
\- Phases can be as short as an afternoon or as long as months

3\. Say Things Out Loud  
\- Helps you go through mental checklists  
\- Activates a different part of your brain than when just thinking  
\- Useful for remembering items to take or tasks to do  
\- Helps organize thoughts and prioritize tasks

4\. Simplify Exercise  
\- Don't count reps or time; let go of doing things the "right way"  
\- Make tasks less daunting to create positive associations  
\- Consistency is more important than perfection  
\- Give yourself permission to do things your own way

5\. Create a "Dumb Mistakes Fund"  
\- Don't lose energy focusing on small financial losses  
\- Set aside money for mistakes (even $100 can make a difference)  
\- Preserve your well-being, which is worth more than minor losses  
\- Have more margin for error in life

6\. Book Time for Hard Tasks  
\- Willpower alone isn't enough for challenging tasks  
\- Schedule time in your calendar for difficult activities  
\- Do hard tasks earlier in the day when possible  
\- Completing tough tasks leads to greater fulfillment

7\. Expose Yourself to Beauty  
\- When feeling scrambled, seek out beautiful experiences  
\- Watch sunrises, take long walks, or cold swims  
\- Breaks thought patterns and brings perspective  
\- Reminds you that stressing more doesn't help  
\- Essential for getting back on track in life
