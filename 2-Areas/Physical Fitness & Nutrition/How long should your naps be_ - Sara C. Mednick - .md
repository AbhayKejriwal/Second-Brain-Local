Title: How long should your naps be?

\- Sleep consists of approximately 90-minute cycles with 4 stages: Stage 1 (first 2-5 minutes), Stage 2 (around 30 minutes), Stage 3 (slow wave sleep, 20-30 minutes), and REM sleep (10-20 minutes).

\- A 30-minute nap mainly includes Stage 2 sleep, which is associated with strengthening neural connections and learning.

\- A 30-60 minute nap takes you into deeper Stage 3 sleep, aiding in memory consolidation, but can be difficult to wake up from.

\- A 60-90 minute nap enters REM sleep, which may promote innovative thinking and creative connections upon waking.

\- The time of day matters: later naps contain more deep sleep, which can interfere with night sleep, while morning naps have more REM sleep.

\- Individual differences exist: nappers tend to experience cognitive benefits, while non-nappers may feel groggy after napping due to entering deeper sleep stages.

\- The benefits of a nap depend on the specific stages of sleep achieved and individual factors, so the only way to know is to try it.
