# How I Code Profitable Apps SOLO (no wasted time / beginner friendly / with AI)

## Mindset & Approach

- Focus on being a problem solver, not just a programmer
- People will pay for solutions that resolve pain, save time, or help them earn money
- Provide genuine value to stand out from others
- Set clear, specific goals instead of vague ones like "I want to learn to code"
- Formula for app ideas: "I want to build an app that does X to solve Y problem for these users"
- Consider solving problems you face personally (scratch your own itch)

## Building Your App

- Focus on a simple, lovable, and complete version of your app
- Choose a programming language based on what you want to build, then stick with it
- Use resources like roadmap.sh to follow focused development paths
- Scrimba offers interactive courses with practical, hands-on learning (80% free content)
- Leverage AI tools to speed up development:
    - Cursor and Windsurf (AI-powered IDEs)
    - V0 for generating responsive UI components
    - ChatGPT for coding assistance

## Monetization

- Choose between one-time payments or subscriptions
- Consider offering a free trial for subscription models
- Payment platforms to consider:
    - Stripe (most popular and developer-friendly)
    - Lemon Squeezy (all-in-one solution with tax handling)
    - Paddle (good for international customers)

## Deployment

- Web apps: Vercel, Netlify
- Mobile apps: App Store, Google Play Store
- Browser extensions: Chrome Web Store, Firefox/Edge add-ons

## Marketing

- Create a high-conversion landing page with:
    - Clear, compelling headline
    - Visuals/demos showing the app in action
    - Social proof (testimonials/reviews)
- Promote on social media and communities (Reddit, Product Hunt, Twitter, niche forums)
- Share your story genuinely rather than using sales tactics

## Continuous Improvement

- Add feedback mechanisms within your app
- Build a community for users to discuss
- Prioritize feedback based on:
    - Frequency (how often mentioned)
    - Feasibility (implementation difficulty)
    - Impact (value to users)
- Iterate quickly - being solo is an advantage for fast updates
