Let me summarize this transcript about Henry George and land value tax in clear bullet points:

* Henry George (1839-1897) was once considered one of the most influential Americans and the most famous economic writer of his time, though he's relatively unknown today

* His book "Progress and Poverty" (1879) sold millions of copies and made him the third most famous man in the US behind Thomas Edison and Mark Twain

* Key life events:
  * Born in Philadelphia, dropped out of Episcopal Academy but continued self-education
  * Worked various jobs including cabin boy, typesetter, and newspaper editor
  * Struggled with poverty early in life, sometimes having to beg for food
  * Eventually found success as a writer and editor in San Francisco

* Core ideas and philosophy:
  * Proposed a "single tax" system based solely on land value
  * Argued that landowners unfairly benefited from economic rent without improving land
  * Supported capitalism but opposed "rigged capitalism" where landowners acted as parasites
  * Believed land was common property that everyone was entitled to
  * His followers became known as "Georgists" and his economic philosophy as "Georgism"

* Benefits of land value tax according to George:
  * More efficient than other taxes as it doesn't create deadweight loss
  * Doesn't discourage production like income or sales taxes
  * Encourages productive use of land rather than speculation
  * Compensates society for exclusive use of common property

* Why Georgism declined:
  * Opposition from powerful landowners and speculators
  * George's singular focus on land tax frustrated other reformers
  * Urban sprawl made land cheaper on city outskirts
  * Alternative reforms like welfare reduced pressure for radical change

* Modern relevance:
  * Variations of land value tax exist in Estonia, Singapore, Denmark, Taiwan, and parts of the US
  * Growing online interest in Georgism among younger people
  * Implementation challenges remain, including the need for widespread adoption and fair transition
