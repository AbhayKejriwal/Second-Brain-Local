Here are the key points from the YouTube video "Why Koreans Dress Better (6 Fashion Tips)":  
  
- Tone on Tone vs Tone in Tone  
- Tone in Tone: Matching same color in different tones/saturations (e.g. navy and light blue)  
- Tone on Tone: Matching different colors in same tone/saturation  
  
- Point (Po)  
- An accent or detail that draws attention and adds character to an outfit (e.g. colored socks, unique item)  
- Avoid having too many "points" as it can look disjointed  
  
- Go vs Goo  
- Go: Trying too hard, looks obvious you put a lot of effort into your look  
- Goo: Effortless, natural look where it doesn't seem like you tried too hard  
  
- Pan (Unexpected Charm)  
- Switching up your usual style for something different can show a new side of your personality  
  
- Limit Colors  
- Stick to 3 colors or less, using black and white as a base to build upon  
  
- Put Your Own Spin on Trends  
- Don't just follow trends exactly, add your personal style twist
