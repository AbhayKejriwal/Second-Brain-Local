### Summary of "If You Run Out Of Things To Say, Play This Simple Game"

- **Awkward Silence**:
    
    - Conversations can sometimes stall, leading to awkward silence.
    - Use tactics to avoid these situations and keep conversations flowing.
- **Five Tips to Keep Conversations Going**:
    
    1. **"Reminds Me of" Game**:
        
        - Look around and say, "You know, that reminds me of..." to start a new topic.
        - Avoid making your story sound superior to others.
    2. **Open-Ended Questions**:
        
        - Use questions that invite detailed answers rather than simple yes/no responses.
        - Example: Instead of "Do you like it there?", say "How do you like living there?"
        - Ask "why" to get people to elaborate and share more.
    3. **Revival Questions**:
        
        - Use when conversation stalls:
            - In a group: "How do you guys all know one another?"
            - One-on-one: "So what's your story?"
        - For familiar people: Ask about future plans to renew conversation.
    4. **Complimentary Cold Read**:
        
        - Make an observation about the person that invites them to share more.
        - Even if wrong, it can lead to a new topic.
    5. **Flip the Script**:
        
        - Be comfortable with silence; it encourages the other person to speak.
        - Repeat back their last few words to invite them to elaborate.
- **Additional Advice**:
