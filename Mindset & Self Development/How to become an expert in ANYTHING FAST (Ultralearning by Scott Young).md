• Scott Young's Ultralearning system:  
  \- Aims to learn new subjects and skills quickly  
  \- Can be applied to various fields like languages, computer science, etc.

• Step 1: Pre-learning  
  \- Plan your learning journey before starting  
  \- Research and create a roadmap for the subject  
  \- Identify vital topics and efficient learning methods  
  \- Set a deadline for pre-learning (about 10% of total project time)

  \- Based on three principles: Focus, Directedness, and Drilling

  1\. Focus  
    \- Eliminate external and internal distractions  
    \- Train focus as a skill through meditation and consistency

  2\. Directedness  
    \- Gear study towards the specific context you'll use the knowledge in  
    \- Practice in situations similar to your end goal

  3\. Drilling  
    \- Identify weaknesses during practice  
    \- Isolate and focus on improving weak areas  
    \- Cycle between direct practice and specific drilling

• Step 3: Reaching the Next Level  
  \- Develop intuition in your chosen field  
  \- Aim to think effortlessly and originally about the subject  
  \- Potential to innovate and expand boundaries in the field
